# Hi there, I'm Ahnaf ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Melbourne who loves building cool projects and startups.

Currently a third-year student at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.

I am building at a startup, [Mechie](https://www.mechie.io/), which is the leetcode for Mechanical Engineers.

My most difficult project: [FluidSim](https://github.com/MonashDeepNeuron/FluidSim)

Previously:
I interned as a software engineer at one of the largest supermarket chains in Australia, [Coles](https://www.coles.com.au/).
I worked at 2 Startups: [Hexa](https://myhexaa.com/) and  SparrowHealthTech.
